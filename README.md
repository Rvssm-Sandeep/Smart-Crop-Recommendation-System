mkdir myproject
cd myproject
py -3 -m venv .venv
```

## Activate the Environment

Before you work on your project, activate the corresponding environment:

On Windows:
```sh

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the cells in your `.ipynb` file to train the model and save it as a `.pkl` file.

## Run the Application

Finally, run the application:

```sh
python app.py
```

Click on the development server link provided in the terminal to open the application in your browser.

That's it!
